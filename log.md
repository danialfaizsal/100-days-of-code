# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Committed to the 100 Days of Code and decided to use the challenge to work through Zed Shaw's Learn Python The Hard Way.

**Thoughts:** First day and already procrastinating! Was supposed to start on exercises but put it off.

### Day 1: August 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed exercise 15 of Learn Python the Hard Way, with today's topic being on reading files. Had to read through and look up a number of functions and study drills required me to do proper commenting of the code, and play around with the code.

**Thoughts**: I did not expect to take so much time on today's exercise, since it was a new topic with a fair bit of study drills to work through, that much was expected.

### Day 1: Feb 3, 2020 (attempt 2 at 100 Days of code)

Actually restarted much earlier than today but decided to commit to this log to push myself to code everyday. Currently taking the Complete Machine Learning and Data Science: Zero to Mastery Udemy course by Andrei Neagoie and Daniel Bourke. Have completed sections 1 - 4 and currently on the learn python path (which I have completed lessons 211 - 247. Today I completed lessons 248 - 253 and learnt about list unpacking, none and dictionaries. My current notes for the python sections are below with my practice code.

-----------------------------

#Fundamental Data types

int
float

# int and float
print(type(2 + 4))
print(type(2 - 4))
print(type(2 * 4))
print(type(2 / 4))
print(type(0))
print(type(5.01))
print(type(9.9+1.1))
print(2 ** 2)
print(2 // 4)
print(7 % 4)
# floating point numbers store binary numbers for each side of decimal point separately

# math functions

bool
str
list
tuple
set
dict

#Classes -> custom types 

#Specialized Data Types

None

#variables best practices

snake_case 
Start with lowercase or underscore
Letters, numbers, underscores
Case sensitive
Donâ€™t overwrite keywords

# Expressions vs Statements
Statement is line of code
Expressions is parts of lines of code

# augmented assignment operator
some_value = 5
some_value += 2
print(some_value)
# variable needs some previous value, operator comes to the left of equal sign

#strings
Strings is a piece of text

# type conversion exercise

import datetime

today = str(datetime.date.today())
current_year = int(today[:4])
birth_year = input('what year were you born?')
age = current_year - int(birth_year)
print(f'Are you going to be {age} this year?')
# Developer Fundamentals 2

* Comments is to include notes on something important happening

# password checker exercise


username = input('Username:')
password = input('Password:')

password_length = len(password)
hidden_password = '*' * password_length

print(f'{username}, your password, {hidden_password}, is {password_length} letters long')


# Matrix

matrix = [
  [1,2,3],
  [2,4,6],
  [7,8,9]
]

print(matrix[0][1])

# List methods

basket = [1,2,3,4,5]

#adding
basket.append(100)
# .insert
# .extend
new_list = basket
print(new_list)

# removing

basket.pop(0)
# .pop remove Index
# .remove remove value
print(basket)
#.clear removes all in the list
# .count number of values
# in to find value in list
# None

weapons = None

print(weapons)

# Dictionary,

dictionary = {
  'a': [1,2,3]
  'b': 'hello'
  'x': True
}

print(dictionary)
# Developer Fundamentals 3

When to use lists versus dictionaries and other types of data structures

# Dictionary keys

* Must be immutable
* Key must be unique


-----------------------------

Also complete exercise 24 of Learn Python the Hard Way - more practice on printing strings and functions.

print("Let's practice everything.")
print('You\'d need to know \'bout escapes with \\ that do:')
print('\n newlines and \t tabs.')

poem = """
\tThe lovely world
with logic so firmly planted
cannot discern \n the needs of love
nor comprehend passion from intuition
and requires an explanation
\n\t\twhere there is none.
"""

print("--------------")
print(poem)
print("--------------")


five = 10 - 2 + 3 - 6
print(f"This should be five: {five}")

def secret_formula(started):
    jelly_beans = started * 500
    jars = jelly_beans / 1000
    crates = jars / 100
    return jelly_beans, jars, crates


start_point = 10000
beans, jars, crates = secret_formula(start_point)

# remember that this is another way to format a string
print("With a starting point of: {}".format(start_point))
# it's just like with an f"" string
print(f"We'd have {beans} beans, {jars} jars, and {crates} crates.")

start_point = start_point / 10

print("We can also do that this way:")
formula = secret_formula(start_point)
# this is an easy way to apply a list to a format string
print("We'd have {} beans, {} jars, and {}crates".format(*formula))

### Day 2: Feb 4, 2020

Forgot to update progress for yesterday, day 2 was mainly practice. I reviewed the article "Python Dictionaries 101: A Detailed Visual Introduction" (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-dictionaries-detailed-visual-introduction/) to go deeper on python dictionaries and wrote a frequencies dictionary as part of the article's exercise:

def freq_dict(data):
    freq = {}
    for elem in data:
        if elem in freq:
            freq[elem] += 1
        else:
            freq[elem] = 1
    return freq

print(freq_dict("Hello, how are you?"))

print(freq_dict([5, 2, 6, 2, 6, 5, 2, 2, 2]))

I also completed exercise 25 of Learn Python the Hard Way which was a practice in creating functions to break up words, sort them and print specific words.

def break_words(stuff):
    """This function will break up words for us."""
    words = stuff.split(' ')
    return words

def sort_words(words):
    """Sorts the words."""
    return sorted(words)

def print_first_word(words):
    """Prints the first word after popping it off."""
    word = words.pop(0)
    print(word)

def print_last_word(words):
    """Prints the last word after popping it off."""
    word = words.pop(-1)
    print(word)

def sort_sentence(sentence):
    """Takes in a full sentence and returns the sorted words."""
    words = break_words(sentence)
    return sort_words(words)

def print_first_and_last(sentence):
    """Prints the first and last words of the sentence."""
    words = break_words(sentence)
    print_first_word(words)
    print_last_word(words)

def print_first_and_last_sorted(sentence):
    """Sorts the words then prints the first and last one."""
    words = sort_sentence(sentence)
    print_first_word(words)
    print_last_word(words)
