# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Committed to the 100 Days of Code and decided to use the challenge to work through Zed Shaw's Learn Python The Hard Way.

**Thoughts:** First day and already procrastinating! Was supposed to start on exercises but put it off.

### Day 1: August 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Completed exercise 15 of Learn Python the Hard Way, with today's topic being on reading files. Had to read through and look up a number of functions and study drills required me to do proper commenting of the code, and play around with the code.

**Thoughts**: I did not expect to take so much time on today's exercise, since it was a new topic with a fair bit of study drills to work through, that much was expected.
